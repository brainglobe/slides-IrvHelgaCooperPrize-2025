## Background {.smaller}
- Imaging key to neuroscience. Excellent open source tools to process microscopy data:
  - MRI (SPM, FSL, AFNI etc)
  - Microscopy (FIJI etc)
- Microscopy data in animal models, moving from small single sections to large multimodal, multidimensional datasets
  - Requires efficient processing of large datasets, but also specific analysis requirements (cell detection etc) and “anatomical context” i.e. registration
  - Whole brain microscopy (serial 2p, LSFM) etc becoming very popular, alongside transcriptomics etc
-Need specific tools

## Background
- Brodmann (1909) - cytoarchitectonic maps
- Wilder Penfield (1950s) - cortical homunculus

## MRI
- MRI Atlas history
  - Standardised coordinate systems (Talairach, MNI etc)
  - Talairach and Tournoux
  - MNI
- Large open source tools (SPM, FSL, AFNI, ANTs etc)
- Standardised processing pipelines (fMRIPrep etc)

## Microscopy {.smaller}
- Moving from single sections to large 3D datasets
- Whole brain microscopy (serial 2p, LSFM) etc becoming very popular
- Need specific tools for large datasets, registration, cell detection etc
  - Require efficient processing of large datasets, but also specific analysis requirements (cell detection etc) and “anatomical context” i.e. registration
- Some tools available, but fragmented ecosystem
- Allen Brain Institute - digital atlases of mouse brain + others
