## Background
- Imaging key to neuroscience. Excellent open source tools to process microscopy data:
  - MRI (SPM, FSL, AFNI etc)
  - Microscopy (FIJI etc)
- Microscopy data in animal models, moving from small single sections to large multimodal, multidimensional datasets
  - Requires efficient processing of large datasets, but also specific analysis requirements (cell detection etc) and “anatomical context” i.e. registration
  - Whole brain microscopy (serial 2p, LSFM) etc becoming very popular, alongside transcriptomics etc
-Need specific tools
