## The BrainGlobe Initiative
- Narrative around building tools for specific purposes/species/atlases
- Fede’s tweet (see neuromatch talk)
- Mention natverse, template flow
- A gap existed with a focus on whole-brain microscopy in mice, rats, zfish etc

## Fragmentation
- Many tools available, but fragmented ecosystem
- Different programming languages (MATLAB, Python, R etc)
- Different data formats (TIFF, NIfTI, HDF5 etc)
- Different atlases (Allen, Kim, Waxholm etc)
- Different species (mouse, rat, zebrafish, human etc)

## BrainGlobe Atlas API
Initial observation - lots of similar communities working independently

- Model species
- Imaging modality
- Anatomical focus
- Developmental stage

## Fragmetation (cont)
- Fede's tweet (see neuromatch talk)

## Efforts
- Natverse (nat - Neuroanatomy Toolbox etc) - R, MATLAB
- TemplateFlow - Python, R, MATLAB

::: {.column width="55%"}
Established 2020 with three aims:

:::{.incremental}
1. Develop general-purpose tools to help others build interoperable software
2. Develop specialist software for specific analysis and visualisation needs
3. Reduce barriers of entry, and facilitate the building of an ecosystem of computational neuroanatomy tools.

## BrainGlobe Initiative
- Fills gap for whole-brain microscopy in mice, rats, zebrafish etc
- Open source, community driven
- Python based (easy to use, powerful libraries, growing community)
- Standardised atlases (BrainGlobe Atlas API)
- Modular design (individual tools can be used independently or together)
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
