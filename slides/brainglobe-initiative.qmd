<!-- 
- Narrative around building tools for specific purposes/species/atlases
- Fedeâ€™s tweet (see neuromatch talk)
- Mention natverse, template flow
- A gap existed with a focus on whole-brain microscopy in mice, rats, zfish etc

# The BrainGlobe Initiative

## Efforts
- May skip this slide and just verbally acknowledge
- Natverse (nat - Neuroanatomy Toolbox etc)
- TemplateFlow

## BrainGlobe Initiative {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
Established 2020 with three aims:

:::{.incremental}
1. Develop general-purpose tools to help others build interoperable software for computational neuroanatomy.
2. Develop specialist software for specific analysis and visualisation needs.
3. Reduce barriers of entry, and facilitate the building of an ecosystem of computational neuroanatomy tools.

## BrainGlobe Initiative {.smaller}
- Fills gap for whole-brain microscopy in mice, rats, zebrafish etc
- Open source, community driven
- Python based (easy to use, powerful libraries, growing community)
- Modular design (individual tools can be used independently or together)
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
